# To Do App
A follow along project with freeCodeCamp where we make a To Do app.

# Follow Along Project Description:
Local storage is a web browser feature that lets web applications store key-value pairs persistently within a user's browser. This allows web apps to save data during one session, then retrieve it in a later page session.

In this TODO application, you'll learn how to handle form inputs, manage local storage, perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on tasks, implement event listeners, and toggle UI elements.

# What I Learned

## classList.toggle() method
I learned to use the .toggle() method on the classList property to toggle classList elements.
It works by toggling the classList. If the classList is present, it will remove the classList.
Converesely, if the classList is not present, the method will add the classList.

## showModal() method
The show modal method populates a modal, or pop up dialogue box in the web browser.
I used the showModal() method within a click eventListener inside of the todo form in confirm whether the changes should be discarded or cancelled.
